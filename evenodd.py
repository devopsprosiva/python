# The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of the first argument by the second.
# The numeric arguments are first converted to a common type.
# A zero right argument raises the ZeroDivisionError exception.
# The arguments may be floating point numbers, e.g., 3.14%0.7 equals 0.34 (since 3.14 equals 4*0.7 + 0.34.)
# The modulo operator always yields a result with the same sign as its second operand (or zero); the absolute value of the result is strictly smaller than the absolute value of the second operand [2].
